# cat-clicker
This is a Udacity class project.  I designed a simple cat clicker. Users can select a cat and the corresponding information will show on the right hand side. Users then click on the picture to increment the click counts.  The main purpose of this project is to seperate view and model so that the code is easier to maintain and flexible for future changes.
